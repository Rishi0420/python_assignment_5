This repository contains two Python programs focusing on dictionary operations and list slicing techniques.

## 📁 Files Included

- `task1.py` - Create a dictionary of student marks and retrieve marks based on user input.
- `task2.py` - Demonstrate list slicing by extracting and reversing elements.

## 📝 Task 1: Create a Dictionary of Student Marks

**Problem Statement:**  
Write a Python program that:
1. Creates a dictionary with student names as keys and their marks as values.
2. Takes a student's name as input from the user.
3. Displays the marks if the name is found in the dictionary.
4. Displays an appropriate message if the name is not found.

**Code Summary:**
- Utilizes a dictionary to store student names and marks.
- Uses `input()` to get the student's name from the user.
- Checks if the entered name exists in the dictionary and displays the corresponding marks.

**Example Output:**
Enter the Student's name: Deepak
Deepak's Marks: 70

## 📝 Task 2: Demonstrate List Slicing

**Problem Statement:**  
Write a Python program that:
1. Creates a list of numbers from 1 to 10.
2. Extracts the first five elements using slicing.
3. Reverses the extracted elements.
4. Prints both the extracted and reversed elements.

**Code Summary:**
- Initializes a list with numbers from 1 to 10.
- Uses slicing to extract the first five elements.
- Reverses the extracted list using slicing with a step of -1.
- Prints the extracted and reversed lists.

**Example Output:**
Original List:  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Extracted First Five Elements: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Reversed First Five Elements: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
